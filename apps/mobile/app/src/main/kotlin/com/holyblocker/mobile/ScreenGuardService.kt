     *  - **Fetch failure.** `declared` counts children the tree says exist;
     *    `fetched` counts the ones `getChild` actually returned. A gap means
     *    nodes are being lost on the way out.
     *  - **Withheld subtree.** `declared == fetched` and still no text. Note this

     *    filtering and `accessibilityDataSensitive` are applied by the framework

     *    all. 1(b) turned out to be exactly this case — `declared == fetched == 16`
     *    with the rows withheld — and was closed by `isAccessibilityTool`. Compare
     *    against a `uiautomator` dump to size the gap, remembering UiAutomation is
     *    exempt from both mechanisms.

     * stay on the screen, same rule as the harvest log above.
